**Vision**: To augment human decision making and machine intelligence for the design of products, processes, and systems. 

This research attempts to establish the computational basis for human-centric design of complex engineered systems with the overall purpose of improving their economic viability, human-machine credibility, and long-term sustainability. The research supports two contemporary goals: (i) to understand how individuals make decisions and (ii) to build intelligent systems to support those decisions. This work impacts two sets of individuals:
- Designers of products and systems:
- End users interacting with products and systems

Research interests:
1. Smart Heuristics for Engineering Design Decision Making
2. Knowledge Representation in Engineering Design 
3. Explainable AI for Data-driven Design
4. Collaboration Systems for Engineering Design Teams
5. Design of Representative Research Settings

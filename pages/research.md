Related research activities lie at the intersections of humans, computers, and systems.

**(Human-Computer) Intelligent Decision Support for Collaborative Design**: How can we adapt existing computational design tools to be smart and usable for supporting collaborative design efforts?

**(Computer-Systems) Knowledge-based Design and Optimization of Engineering Systems**: The data-driven design approach requires large data. How can we use domain knowledge to reduce data dependency and achieve the expert human-level efficiency using much less data?

**(Human-Systems): Systemic Design for Human-in-the-Loop Cyber Physical Systems**: Engineering systems are designed for specific system objectives, yet users using those have flexible needs. How do we design new product development and manufacturing systems to be human-centered while being economic and sustainable?
